<h2>1. Introduction
<a name="1. Introduction"></a>
</h2>


<h3>1.1. Project Overview
<a name="1.1. Project Summary"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Gomoku</i> The Gomoku project is aimed to let users play Gomoku everywhere as long as they have an internet connection.<br>
       This software integrated a powerful AI that is really difficult to be beaten by human users. </p>

<h3>1.1.1. Purpose
<a name="1.1.1. Purpose"></a>
</h3>
       
<p>We aim to make Gomoku more popular and help users with using different ways of thinking by building a strong AI.</p>
       
<h3>1.1.2. Scope
<a name="1.1.2. Scope"></a>
</h3>

<p>
       We aim to build a strong AI that can not be easily beaten by human users with an efficient algorithm and quicker response time. <br>
      Also we will make the user interface clean to be sure the element on the interface would not attract too much attention from users when they are thinking.
</p>
       
<h3>1.1.3. Constrains
<a name="1.1.3. Constrains"></a>
</h3>
       
<p>The biggest constraint on this project will be time. We have a set timeline to accomplish the objectives we have declared. Furthermore, our understanding<br>
       of the software we have available to us may be another limitation. It's possible that members will have to learn how to use this software before being<br>
       able to implement the objectives. Another constraint is time difference. Many group members are not in Canada and the whole group will suffer from time<br>
       difference.</p>
       
<h3>1.2. Evolution Plan

<p>This section will be updated as we progress through the project.

<h3>4.1. Product Perspective
<a name="4.1. Product Perspective"></a>
</h3>
    
<p>There will be two major components to this application, front-end and back-end.<br>
   <br>

Front-end will deal with the user experience/interface. The goal is to create a GUI that is pleasant and easy to use.<br>
       The GUI will be appealing; chess board and chess are two necessary elements. Also there will be some button for other<br>
       useful function such as history record and the total chess number<br>
<br>
Back-end will deal with the algorithms to find the best position on the board to put the chess. The goal is to let the algorithm<br>
       “think deeper” to find the “trap” the user makes. 
</p>
       
<h3>4.2. Organization Structure
<a name="4.2. Organization Structure"></a>
</h3>
       
<p>To accomplish all the project requirements, we will divide ourselves into groups and each group will be responsible<br>
       for completing certain tasks. One person from the group will be responsible for communicating with the rest of the<br>
       team and making their work available for the rest of the team. There will be a testing team who will work on testing<br>
       the implementation and assure that the application will be able to work properly for any possible case. The members who<br>
       were a part of implementation will not be a part of the testing team. </p>

<h3>5.1. Project start-up plan
<a name="5.1. Project start-up plan"></a>
</h3>
       
<h3>5.1.1. Staffing Plan
<a name="5.1.1. Staffing Plan"></a>
</h3>
       
<p>For this project, we are working with a team of 11 members. We plan on dividing ourselves into smaller groups based on skill<br>
       level and interest to work on different aspects of the project such as design, prototyping and implementation. There are<br>
       two documentation, Requirements document and SPMP that need to be worked on and updated as we go. <br>
<br>
A small group of the team members who are interested in preparing the documentation will be responsible for the documentation.<br>
       At least one of the members should be experienced with HTML and take the responsibility of creating the document through HTML.<br>
       As per the analysis and design, both must be object-oriented and so the team members working on these should have a fair amount<br>
       of knowledge on object-oriented programming or are willing to learn it in the given time frame. <br>
<br>
For prototyping, a small group of the team members will be responsible for designing the looks for this application and creating options<br>
       for how the users can interact with the application. At least one person should be familiar with UX design and Figma, overall,<br>
       everyone should be willing to learn about the UI development process and work with a creative mind set. For front and back end,<br>
       the members responsible should be experienced with the languages being used. They should also be willing to put in sometime to learn<br>
       new material that may be required for the implementation. The testing crew will be members of the team that have not worked on the<br>
       implementation. They should be able to consider all possible cases that might occur when other users start using the application and<br>
       make sure the application is capable of handling the cases.
</p>
       
<h3>5.1.2. Project staff training plan
<a name="5.1.2. Project staff training plan"></a>
</h3>

<p>A basic understanding of some software will be required for the completion of this project. Each group member will be responsible for learning<br>
       any new material/software that is required to complete the deliverables they have chosen.
